In the LLM Generated solution the uri[5:] expression directly skips the first 5 characters, which assumes that the input URI will always start with s3://.
 While it will work for valid S3 URIs, it will fail for malformed inputs, such as those missing the scheme or having an incorrect scheme. For example, if a user mistakenly provides http://my-bucket/my/prefix, the code will raise an IndexError since uri[5:] will be attempting to slice from a string that doesn't conform to the expected format.
