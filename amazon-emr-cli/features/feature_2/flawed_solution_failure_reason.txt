The LLM generated prompt failed due to-
1. It constructs the S3 URI for the entry point file incorrectly using os.path.join(prefix, self.entry_point_path). This results in an incorrect path that includes the full local path instead of just the filename.
2. The log messages include the local path instead of the S3 URI, which could confuse users or developers trying to debug the deployment process. The prompt specifies that the deployment should be logged in a way that clearly indicates where the files are being uploaded in the S3 bucket.
3. The return statement return self.entrypoint_uri() suggests that the method relies on an external method to generate the S3 URI. This is problematic because:
  a. If self.entrypoint_uri() is not implemented correctly, it may lead to further failures.
  b. It fails to meet the explicit requirement from the prompt to return the S3 URI of the uploaded entry point directly.
