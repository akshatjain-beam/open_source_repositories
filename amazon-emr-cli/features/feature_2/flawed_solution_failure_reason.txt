The LLM-generated prompt failed because the model incorrectly combined the `prefix` and `filename`. It assumed both should be added sequentially, which does not conform to the correct format for defining the file path, leading to test failures. Additionally, the LLM-generated solution did not follow the specified string format for the return type mentioned in the prompt. The prompt stated that `prefix` and `filename` should be joined with a forward slash, but the generated solution omitted this requirement.
