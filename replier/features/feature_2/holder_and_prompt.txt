//Construct a code snippet that dynamically processes a text input where a placeholder (e.g., @person) needs to be replaced with a properly formatted mention string (<@userID>) for a messaging platform.
//Note-
// 1. The placeholder is assumed to be in the exact form @person (not case-insensitive, and no extra characters or numbers).
// 2. The code must handle multiple instances of the placeholder in the same string replacing them all.
