The error checking in the LLM generated solution is a significant issue. , that is causing test cases to be failed.
1. The LLM generated solution checks for "biosphere" exchanges at the end of the processing loop using a lambda function and an any() call. This delayed error check means that the function continues to process all exchanges even after identifying a problematic exchange. This could lead to multiple cascading issues, as the function may still attempt to link other exchanges or may not provide immediate feedback about the first error it encounters.
2. Lack of appropriate try-except handling for key errors can lead to unhandled exceptions that terminate the process abruptly.
