"""
Calculate fractional change values from year start to year end.
The change is calculated as (value at end - value at start) / value at start.
Assumes years are the last axis of the array. Code should handle both numpy array and list datatypes for `years`.

Parameters:
- dataset (numpy.ndarray): A NumPy array where the last axis represents different years.
- years (iterable): An iterable (like numpy array or list) containing the years corresponding to the last axis of `dataset`.
- start (int or float): The starting year for calculating the relative change.
- end (int or float): The ending year for calculating the relative change.

Returns:
- numpy.ndarray: An array of the same shape as `dataset` but with the last axis reduced, containing the fractional change values from the year `start` to the year `end`.
