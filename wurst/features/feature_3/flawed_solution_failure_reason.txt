The LLM generated solution-
1. Lacks checks for dimensionality and assumes a flat mapping, which results in retrieving only single values (not arrays) for potentially multi-dimensional data.
where as it is explictly mentioned in the prompt-If the input array is 1D, the function returns a dictionary with scalar values. If the input array is 2D or higher, the function returns a dictionary with array values.‚Äù
2. Treats all values as scalars without considering their potential to be arrays, in teh output.
