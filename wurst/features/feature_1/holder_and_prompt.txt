Create a function `get_generators_in_mix` that retrieve the names of input generators for a specified electricity mix.

- This function scans a database of activities and extracts the names of all input 
    generators associated with a specific electricity mix.
- Then the filtered activities call the `technosphere()` method to returns 
    an iterable of exchanges, where each exchange has an `input` 
    attribute that is a dictionary containing the keys "name" and "unit".
- Then the value of "unit" is compared with the default value "kilowatt hour", and
    filter outs the value of "name" key of the `input` attribute

Args:
    db (object): A collection of activities, that support dictionary access and have a `technosphere()` method.
        Each Exchange object from `technosphere()` must have an `input` attribute containing
        producer information with `unit` and `name` keys.
    name (str, optional): The name of the electricity mix to search for. 
                            Defaults to "market for electricity, high voltage".

Returns:
    set: A set of unique names of the input generators

Note:
    This function assumes that the `technosphere()` method of each activity
