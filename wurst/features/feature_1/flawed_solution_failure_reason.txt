The LLM-generated solution fails to correctly define the `input` attribute as part of the iterative output from the `technosphere()` method. Instead, it incorrectly treats `input` as a key in the dictionary output. The retrieval of `input` as an attribute for further calculations is explicitly stated in the prompt, but this instruction was overlooked by the LLM model.
