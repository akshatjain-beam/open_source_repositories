"""
Filters and updates a list of projects based on specified criteria and saves the updated list to a file.

Args:
    tdpath (str): The path to the file from which the current list of projects is read.
    editpath (str): The path to the file where the updated list of projects will be saved.
    terms (list of str): A list of terms used to filter projects. Projects must either contain any of these terms
                            (if `exact` is False) or match exactly one of these terms (if `exact` is True).
    exact (bool): Indicates whether the project names should match exactly with the terms provided.

Returns:
    set: A set of project names from the updated list, excluding any entry that is "_None".

Description:
    - Reads the current list of projects from the file at `tdpath`.
    - Filters the projects based on the provided `terms` and `exact` criteria:
        - If `terms` is provided and a project does not contain any of these terms, it is removed.
        - If `exact`, only projects that exactly match any term in `terms` are kept.
    - If no projects remain after filtering and `terms` is provided with at least one term, a new project
        is created using the first term in `terms` and added to the list.
    - Writes the updated list of projects to the file at `editpath`.
    - Returns a set of project names from the updated list, excluding any entry that is "_None".
