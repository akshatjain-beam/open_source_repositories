Differences Between Correct and Flawed Solutions

1. Bit Field Byte Preparation:
   - Correct Solution: Inside the loop, it checks the length of `bytes` and prepares `bitFieldBytes` accordingly for each `bitField` in `m.bitFields`. If `bytes` is less than `wordLengthUpperLimitBytes`, it pads `bitFieldBytes` with zeros at the start.
   - Flawed Solution: The check for the length of `bytes` is done outside the loop. This means `bitFieldBytes` is set once, and the same reference is used for all fields, which does not account for varying lengths that may be required when processing each bit field.

2. Bit Field Unmarshaling:
   - Correct Solution: Calls `unmarshal` for each bit field using the correct `bitFieldBytes` prepared for each iteration of the loop.
   - Flawed Solution: It incorrectly uses `bitFieldBytes[wordLengthUpperLimitBytes-m.lengthInBytes:]`, which can lead to slicing errors, particularly when `m.lengthInBytes` exceeds the length of `bitFieldBytes`.

Why the Tests Failed

Test case which the flawed solution fails (TestWordMetadataUnmarshal)
- The relevant prompt section:
  > "The function will then unmarshal the bit field bytes into the respective struct field using reflection."

- Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case:
  The flawed solution incorrectly processes the `bitFieldBytes` by using a slice that assumes `m.lengthInBytes` is always valid. If `bytes` is smaller than `wordLengthUpperLimitBytes`, the calculated slice can result in an index out of range error because the length of `bitFieldBytes` may not support that slice operation. Specifically, the code attempts to access indices in `bitFieldBytes` that may not exist when `len(bytes)` is less than the expected limit.
