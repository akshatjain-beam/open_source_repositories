"""
Determines the syllable's diacritic and tone number from the given syllable string.

This function processes a syllable string to extract its diacritic and tone number.
It handles specific cases such as the syllable "r" and identifies tones based on 
the presence of numeric characters and vowel groups.

Parameters:
- syl (str): The input syllable string to be analyzed. It should be a non-empty string 
    representing a syllable, which may end with a tone number (1-5) or contain diacritic vowels.

Returns:
- tuple: A tuple containing two elements:
    1. `diacritic_syl` (str): The syllable with diacritic applied, if applicable, or the original syllable.
    2. `tone` (int): The tone number (1-5) extracted from the syllable. If no tone is explicitly 
        indicated, it is determined based on vowel groups.

Raises:
- ValueError: If the syllable string does not conform to expected patterns or contains unexpected 
    characters.

Notes:
- The function handles edge cases, such as the syllable "r" which is a special case in CC-CEDICT.
- The `DIACRITIC_VOWELS` variable is used to match and identify diacritic vowels in the syllable.
