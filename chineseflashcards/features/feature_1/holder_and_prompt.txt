# Create a class called `Classifier` to handle three types of Chinese text inputs: traditional characters, simplified characters, and pinyin. 
# 
# - Initialization (`__init__` method):
#   - Create a new `Classifier` object, while providing three pieces of information: traditional characters, simplified characters, and pinyin. These are stored in the instance variables `trad`, `simp`, and `pinyin`.
# 
# - Parsing (`parse` class method):
#   - Input
#       - A single string that contains the three components (traditional characters, simplified characters, and pinyin)
#   - Process
#       - The class also has a method called `parse` that takes a single string as input and extracts the three components (traditional characters, simplified characters, and pinyin) from it.
#       - Split the string at `|`. If present, the part before `|` is traditional characters; the part after is split at `[` to separate simplified characters from pinyin.
#       - If `|` is absent, treat the both traditional and simplified characters as same, and split at `[` to extract pinyin.
#       - The method then trims any trailing `]` from the pinyin.
#   - Output
#       - The method returns a new `Classifier` object with the extracted values
