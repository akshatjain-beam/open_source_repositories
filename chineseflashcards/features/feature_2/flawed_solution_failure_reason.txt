The LLM-generated code has the following issues:
1. The code checks if the Traditional and Simplified values are equal. If they are equal, it assigns the Simplified variable to `None`, which was neither mentioned nor requested in the prompt.
2. The code is unable to unpack all the values from `regex.match`. It has fewer parameters on the left-hand side than needed to unpack the values from the regex match.
3. The code incorrectly processes classifiers when splitting the definitions due to improper string slicing issues.
