The LLM solution encountered a failure due to the following issue:
1. For the third condition of the prompt, which states, "If the task does not have a priority but has a completion date at the start, it inserts the new priority after the completion date," the implementation does not adhere to the prompt guidelines. It only verifies whether the `raw` string begins with `x `, which is incorrect. According to the prompt, this condition requires checking for `completion_date` in the format `x YYYY-MM-DD` before inserting the priority after the completion date. This crucial step has been overlooked in the LLM-generated code, which only checks for `x ` and adds the priority after that.
