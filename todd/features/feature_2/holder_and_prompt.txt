    Mark the task as done or undone and update its status accordingly.

    If the task is already in the desired state (i.e., done or not done), this method does nothing.
    If the task is being marked as done, it:
    - Removes its priority.
    - Updates the task's raw string to include the completion marker (`x `), the current date[iso format], and the existing raw string..
    - Adjusts the due date if the task has a recurrence interval by-
        - The recurrence interval is parsed into its prefix, value, and interval type using a regular expression.
        - The prefix determines whether to add the recurrence interval to the current due date ("+")[BY using get_due()] or today's date.
        - The Util.date_add_interval function is used to calculate the new due date.

    If the task is being marked as undone, it removes the completion marker from the task's raw string.

    Args:
        done (bool, optional): Whether to mark the task as done. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        None or datetime: If the task is marked as done and has a recurrence interval, returns the new due date. Otherwise, returns None.
