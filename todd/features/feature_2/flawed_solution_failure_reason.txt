The LLM generated solution fails as-
1. The LLM generated solution does not properly check whether the task is already in the desired state before attempting to update it. As a result, if set_done(True) is    called multiple times, it incorrectly appends multiple completion markers to the raw string. This leads to outputs like x {date} x {date} Sample task, which is incorrect.
    While it is explictly mentioned in prompt -"If the task is already in the desired state (i.e., done or not done), this method does nothing."
    ex[from unit test case]- 'x 2024-10-11 x 2024-10-11 Sample task'
2.simply uses self.raw = self.raw[2:].strip(), which naively removes the first two characters. While it is not throwing immedidate error, it is prone to errors. When the whole repo with multiple interconnection is made to run, it may lead to situation where -task was marked done multiple times. It can result in wrong formatting.
