The LLM solution did not follow the prompt instructions correctly. It assumed that the prompt required the removal of extra newlines from the final output, rather than adhering to the explicit instruction to remove only the "last extra newline if present in the input text." Consequently, the LLM incorrectly removed newlines from the output, which was not specified in the prompt.
