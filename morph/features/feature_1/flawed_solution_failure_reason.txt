The LLM Generated solution falied due to -
1. It can incorrectly identify non-sequence objects as sequence-like if they implement both __getitem__ and __iter__. 
    ex- a custom object that has these methods but doesn't logically represent a sequence (e.g., a custom object that uses these methods for some other purpose) would pass this check.
2. It doesn't check for dictionaries[Explictly mentioned in prompt]]. It allows them to be included as sequence-like objects.
