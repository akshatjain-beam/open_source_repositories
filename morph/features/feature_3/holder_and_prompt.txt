"""
    Write line of codes that processes key-value pairs or attributes from a source, filtering and modifying keys based on a specified prefix.
    It handles two cases depending on whether `items` is provided or not:
    - If `items` is provided- 
        -The code iterates over the items (which is expected to be a list of key-value pairs).
        -For each key-value pair, it checks if the key starts with the given prefix.
        -If it does, it constructs a new dictionary where the key is the original key with the prefix removed.
    - If `items` is not provided-
        -The code iterates over the attributes of the source object.
        -It checks if each attribute name starts with the prefix.
        -If it does, it creates a new dictionary where the key is the attribute name with the prefix removed.
