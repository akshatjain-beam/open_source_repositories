The LLM Generated solution fails as, it directly calls `k.startswith(prefix)`. This assumes that k is always a string (or at least has the startswith method).
If k is not a string (for example - an integer or None), this will raise an AttributeError. For example - in the provided test case with non-string keys (like 123), it will lead to a failure.
