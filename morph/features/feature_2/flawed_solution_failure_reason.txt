The LLM Genearted solution fails as - Explicitly, the prompt does not ask to check if the given object is a sequence, yet the generated solution does so anyway. Furthermore, the implementation of the isseq function calls the isdict function, and conversely, the LLM implementation of the isdict function calls the isseq function. This creates a circular dependency, leading to an infinite recursion loop that results in an error.
