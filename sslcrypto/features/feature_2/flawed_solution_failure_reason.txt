Unit test failed -Test Case: test_numbers_2, Test Case: test_numbers
Relevant prompt section -"This line of code first applies the AND operation to combine ( x ) and ( y ), then modifies ( x ) by taking its complement (NOT) and converting it to its positive 32-bit equivalent using modulo ( 0x100000000 ). Next, it performs an AND operation with ( z ) and finally merges both results using OR, returning the final outcome."

Reason - The LLM  Generated solution incorrectly takes complement of `z`, instaed of `x` as expliclty mentioned in the pormpt. Leading to errornous result.
