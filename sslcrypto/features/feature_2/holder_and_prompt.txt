"""
This line of code first applies the AND operation to combine ( x ) and ( y ), then modifies ( x ) by taking its complement (NOT) and converting it to its positive 32-bit equivalent using modulo ( 0x100000000 ). Next, it performs an AND operation with ( z ) and finally merges both results using OR, returning the final outcome.
