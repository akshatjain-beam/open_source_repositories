"""  
Create a function `ROL` that Performs a left rotation (circular shift) on a 32-bit integer, `x`, by `n` bits.

A left rotation shifts all bits of `x` to the left by `n` positions, with the bits that 
overflow on the left end wrapping around to the right end. This function ensures that 
the left-shifted result remains within a 32-bit range by applying a bitwise AND operation with 0xFFFFFFFF
before combining it with the right-shifted portion.

Parameters:
    n (int): The number of positions to rotate `x` to the left.
    x (int): The 32-bit integer to be rotated.

Returns:
    int: The result of rotating `x` to the left by `n` bits, masked to fit within 32 bits.
