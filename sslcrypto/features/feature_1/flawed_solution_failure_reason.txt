Unit tets failed- test_rol_5
Relevant prompt section - "This function ensures that the left-shifted result remains within a 32-bit range by applying a bitwise AND operation with 0xFFFFFFFF before combining it with the right-shifted portion."

Reason- The incorrect implementation generated by the language model leads to an assertion error because it fails to handle the left rotation of negative numbers correctly. The prompt explicitly states that the bitwise AND operation with 0xFFFFFFFF should be applied before combining the left-shifted result with the right-shifted portion. However, the model's solution performs this AND operation at the end, after using the OR operator to combine the two results. This change in order of operations alters the precedence of the bitwise operations, resulting in an incorrect output.
