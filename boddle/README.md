# Boddle
A unit testing tool for Python's bottle library.  We wrote this for our own testing purposes at https://www.hvst.com.  Thanks [brenguyen711](https://github.com/brenguyen711) for the great name!

### Commit Hash
hash => 74413e4c5b39a37ea1694fab07b459ccd2998390

## Install
```
sudo pip install boddle
```

## Usage
Assuming you have a bottle route like this:

```python
@bottle.get('/woot')
def woot():
  return bottle.request.params['name']
```

You can unit test it like:

```python
import unittest
from boddle import boddle

class TestIt(unittest.TestCase):
  def testWoot(self):
    with boddle(params={'name':'derek'}):
      self.assertEqual(woot(), 'derek')
```
See [`example.py`](example.py).

### Options

The Bottle-specific params that are supported are:

| Argument | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| `params` | Populates `request.params`.  Takes a `dict` or list of pairs.  Useful for both POST and GET params. |
| `path` | The path component of the url.  Populates `request.path`, which always has a preceeding `/`. |
| `method` | POST, GET, etc.  Bottle will uppercase the value. |
| `headers` | Any HTTP headers.  Takes a `dict`. |
| `json` | Takes anything that can be consumed by `json.dumps()`.  Also sets the content type of the request. |
| `url` | The full URL, protocol, domain, port, path, etc.  Will be parsed until its `urlparts` before populating `request.url`. |
| `body` | The raw body of the request.  Takes either a `str` or a file-like object.  `str`s will be converted into file-like objects.  Populated `request.body`. |
| `query` | Populates `request.query`.  Takes a `dict`.  |

All other keyword arguments will be assigned to the request object.  For instance, we often do:
```python
with boddle(current_user=someone):
  # code that accesses bottle.request.current_user
```

You can also nest `boddle` calls.  For instance:
```python
with boddle(path='/woot'):
  with boddle(params={'name':'derek'}):
    # both path and params are set here
  # only path is set here
```

**ALL CHANGES TO `bottle.request` ARE REVERTED WHEN THE WITH BLOCK ENDS.**
