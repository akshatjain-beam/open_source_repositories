# - Override the inbuilt `enter` function:
#  - First, it saves the current request environment so that it can be accessed by other methods later.
#  - Then, it replaces the current request environment with a new environment.
#  - It goes through each key-value pair in the `extras` dictionary. For each pair, if the request object already has the same attribute, it saves the original value and then sets the new value from `extras`.
#  - Finally, it adds an `app` attribute to the `BaseRequest` and sets this to `True`.
# - Override the inbuilt `exit` function:
# - First, it restores the original request environment that was saved earlier.
# - Then, for each key-value pair in the `extras` dictionary:
#     - If the key exists in the saved original values, it sets the attribute back to the original value.
#     - Else, delete the attribute from the request object. If error is thrown, handle it without doing anything.
# - Finally, set the `app` attribute to its original state.
