"""
Create a class method `_build_routes` that create Bottle routes for a handler HTTP method.

This method constructs a list of route endpoints based on the provided 
method arguments and an optional URL extra part.

If no arguments are provided, return just the base endpoint.
For each combination of arguments, create routes that follow the structure of the base endpoint, 
appending parameters appropriately and ensuring correct formatting.

Args:
    cls (type): The class from which the method is called
    method_args (list): A list of argument names to be included as 
                        dynamic parameters in the route.
    url_extra_part (str, optional): An optional additional path segment 
                                        to append to the base endpoint. 
                                        Defaults to None.

Returns:
    list: A list of constructed endpoint routes

Note:
    the code uses old route syntax for defining dynamic parameters, eg `:name`
