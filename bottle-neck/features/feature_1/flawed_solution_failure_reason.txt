The llm generated code has following issues and deviates significantly from the prompt's requirements.:
1. Misuse of lru_cache: The functools.lru_cache decorator is intended for instance methods and functions, not for class properties. It caches the result of the decorator function itself rather than the function it is supposed to wrap.
2. Lack of Proper Caching Mechanism: This solution does not implement a caching mechanism where the class attribute __cache is used. It fails to attach the computed result to the class as a direct attribute.
3. Function Wrapper: The return statement classproperty(property(fun)) does not effectively create a cached class property. It wraps the function in a way that is not compatible with the intended caching behavior.
