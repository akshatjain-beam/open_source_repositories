"""
Create a function `cached_classproperty` which is a decorator to 
create a cached class property.

It implements the above `classproperty` decorator, with
the difference that the function result is computed and attached
to class as direct attribute. (Lazy loading and caching.)

The cache is maintained in a class attribute named `__cache`, where the 
function itself is used as the key for caching.

Args:
    fun: The method to be cached as a class property.

Returns:
    A class property that returns the cached value.

Note:
    AttributeError is raised: If the cache cannot be initialized.
    KeyError is raised: If the cache does not contain the value.
