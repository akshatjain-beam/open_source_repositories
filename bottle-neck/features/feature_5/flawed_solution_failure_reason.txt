1. Lack of Specificity: The LLM-generated code lacks the specificity of the original implementation. It only extracts the status code from the status line and constructs a basic response object using the provided message or the status line itself. This fails to capture the complexity of how responses should be built based on specific status codes, as outlined in the prompt and exemplified in the prompt example.
2. Incorrect Handling of Missing Messages: The llm solution assumes that if the error message (msg) is not provided, it should default to using the status line as the error message. However, the prompt does not suggest this behavior.
3. Ignoring Class Method Invocation: The llm solution does not correctly implement the dynamic invocation of the appropriate class method based on the status line, which is crucial for generating the correct response type for various HTTP errors. Also, this is mentioned in the prompt as well, that the return value of the function should be class method based on the status_line args.
