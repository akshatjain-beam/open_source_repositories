Test case which the flawed solution fails
`test_from_status_200, test_from_status_201, test_from_status_304, test_from_status_401, test_from_status_403, test_from_status_404, test_from_status_405, test_from_status_501, test_from_status_503`

The relevant prompt section
"The status_line input should be converted to lowercase, with only alphabetic characters considered, and spaces replaced with underscores. Numeric status code should be excluded."

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case
The flawed solution does not correctly exclude the numeric status code from the `status_line` before attempting to retrieve the method. Instead of extracting and using the appropriate method associated with the status code (like `service_unavailable` for '503 Service Unavailable'), it ends up defaulting to `cls.bad_request`, resulting in a status code of 400 being returned. This causes the test to fail, as the expected status code (503) does not match the returned code (400). The flawed logic fails to properly map the input to the correct method due to incorrect string manipulation, leading to a failure across multiple test cases with similar issues.
