The LLM Generated solution fails as-
1. It multiplies the sum of products by 10 before applying the modulo operation, which is no where mentioned in the prompt.
2. The flawed solution only calculates the modulo of the sum but fails to implement the necessary condition[as mentioned in the prompt] to subtract from 11 when the result is greater than 1.
