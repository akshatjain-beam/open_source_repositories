1. Normalize the state name: convert to uppercase and trim whitespace.
2. Slugify the city name using `slug` function and replace "sant_ana" with "santana."
3. Correct common misspellings using CITY_SPELL_MAP for city names.

   - Split into words, with splitor as underscores.
   - Use WORD_MAP for word replacements; exclude BLOCK_WORDS.
5. Construct the final `slug` string in the format `STATE CITY`.

The function uses `functools.lru_cache` to cache results for frequently requested state-city combinations with max size of `5570*2`.

Args:
    state (str): The name of the state.
    city (str): The name of the city.

Returns:
    str: A slugified value.
