def city_key(state: str, city: str) -> str:
    """
    Generates a slugified key for a state-city combination.

    1. Normalize the state name: convert to uppercase and trim whitespace.
    2. Slugify the city name using `slug` function and replace "sant_ana" with "santana."
    3. Correct common misspellings using CITY_SPELL_MAP for city names, If (state, city) key is not present in the CITY_SPELL_MAP, then use the city name as default value.
    4. Process the city names in string format with space in between each city name:
       - Split into words, with splitor as underscores.
       - Use WORD_MAP for word replacements; exclude BLOCK_WORDS.
    5. Construct the final slugified string of `STATE CITY` .

    The function uses `functools.lru_cache` to cache results for frequently requested state-city combinations with max size of `5570*2`.

    Args:
        state (str): The name of the state.
        city (str): The name of the city.

    Returns:
        str: A slugified value.
