The LLM-generated solution contains the following issues:

1. The LLM code is attempting to slugify the city values using a separator `_`, which is incorrect. The prompt never asked to slugify the city when filtering the cities with `BLOCK_WORDS`. 
2. The `slug` function does not have a `sep` argument, raising the `unexpected keyword argument` error
3. The return value is not slugified using the `slug` function, which was explicitly mentioned in the prompt to slugify the return string.
