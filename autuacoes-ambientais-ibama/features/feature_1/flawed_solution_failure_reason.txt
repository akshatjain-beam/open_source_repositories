Test Case: test_city_key_standard , test_city_key_with_mappings
Relevant Prompt Section:
Correct common misspellings using CITY_SPELL_MAP for city names, if (state, city) key is not present in the CITY_SPELL_MAP, then use the city name as default value.
Reason for Failure:
The LLM-generated solution mistakenly attempts to unpack `state, city = CITY_SPELL_MAP[(state, city)]`, anticipating two values rather than one. This flawed approach causes a `ValueError` because the value for the `(state, city)` key in `CITY_SPELL_MAP` is actually a single corrected city name, not a pair. The dictionary provides only one value, which the LLM solution incorrectly tries to assign to both `state` and `city`, leading to the error.

Test Case: test_city_key_with_block_words
Relevant Prompt Section:
Process the city names in string format with space in between each city name: Split into words, with splitor as underscores. Use WORD_MAP for word replacements; exclude BLOCK_WORDS.
Reason for Failure:
Although the LLM Generated solution correctly processes the city name with word mapping and block words, it never reaches this point due to the ValueError encountered when trying to unpack the CITY_SPELL_MAP value.

Test Case: test_city_key_edge_cases
Relevant Prompt Section:
Normalize the state name: convert to uppercase and trim whitespace.
Process the city names in string format with space in between each city name: Split into words, with splitor as underscores. Use WORD_MAP for word replacements; exclude BLOCK_WORDS.
Reason for Failure:
The incorrect handling of CITY_SPELL_MAP prevents the function from proceeding to process normalization and word mapping correctly. The ValueError occurs first, leading to test failures.
