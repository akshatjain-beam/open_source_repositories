Test case which the flawed solution fails: `test_start_requests`

The relevant prompt section:  
"Iterates over a range of dates from `self.start_date` to one year beyond `self.end_date`, with a 'yearly' step using `date_range` function."

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case:  
The flawed solution uses the `date_format` parameter in the `date_range` function call, which is not a valid argument for that function. This results in a `TypeError`, preventing the function from executing and iterating over the date range as required by the prompt.

Test case which the flawed solution fails: `test_start_requests_empty_date_range`

The relevant prompt section:  
"Iterates over a range of dates from `self.start_date` to one year beyond `self.end_date`, with a 'yearly' step using `date_range` function."

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case:  
The same issue of the invalid `date_format` parameter arises here, leading to a `TypeError`. This prevents the function from iterating correctly, even when the date range is empty.

Test case which the flawed solution fails: `test_start_requests_empty_state_codes`

The relevant prompt section:  
"Iterates over a range of dates from `self.start_date` to one year beyond `self.end_date`, with a 'yearly' step using `date_range` function."

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case:  
The inclusion of the `date_format` parameter causes a `TypeError`. The failure to execute the date iteration means that the expected behavior in the test cannot be achieved.

Test case which the flawed solution fails: `test_start_requests_mixed_requests`

The relevant prompt section:  
"Iterates over a range of dates from `self.start_date` to one year beyond `self.end_date`, with a 'yearly' step using `date_range` function."

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case:  
As with previous tests, the invalid `date_format` parameter results in a `TypeError`, halting the function's execution. This prevents the generation of the mixed requests expected in the test.

Test case which the flawed solution fails: `test_start_requests_multiple_years`

The relevant prompt section:  
"Iterates over a range of dates from `self.start_date` to one year beyond `self.end_date`, with a 'yearly' step using `date_range` function."

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case:  
The use of the `date_format` parameter again leads to a `TypeError`. The inability to iterate through the multiple years means the test fails to validate the intended functionality.
