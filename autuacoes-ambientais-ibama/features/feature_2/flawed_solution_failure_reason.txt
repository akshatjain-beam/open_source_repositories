The LLM Generated solution fails due to-
1.The flawed solution constructs possible state names by joining parts one by one and checking against STATE_NAMES. However, it starts by adding only the first part to state_parts, which might not form a valid state name, especially for states with multi-word names.This approach assumes that the first word will either be a state acronym or part of a full state name. However, many states have names that consist of multiple words.
    for ex- states likes -> Rio de Janeiro, the flawed solution might prematurely check and fail to find the state because it does not build the state name correctly before checking. It can cause valid state and city pairs to be unrecognized and lead to unnecessary errors,
2. The logic fails to correctly identify the acronym when checking against STATE_CODES. ex-"CE", "Itapaje" as without proper checks to identify "CE" as a valid state acronym, the function raises a ValueError instead of returning the expected tuple.
