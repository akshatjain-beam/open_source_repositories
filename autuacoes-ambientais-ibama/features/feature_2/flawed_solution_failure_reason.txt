Test case which the flawed solution fails: `test_full_state_name_rio_grande_do_sul`

The relevant prompt section:
The prompt specifies that the function should create a `slug` from the words up to the current index and check for a match in the predefined `STATE_NAMES` dictionary.

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case:
In the flawed solution, the `slug` function is not being used to generate the key for `STATE_NAMES`. Instead, it attempts to directly construct a string from the words. This means it doesn't format the string in the way expected by the `STATE_NAMES` dictionary. Since "Rio Grande do Sul" requires proper slug formation (likely involving normalization, lowercasing, or specific formatting), the failure to create a slug results in the dictionary lookup failing, leading to a `ValueError`.

Test case which the flawed solution fails: `test_full_state_name_sao_paulo`

The relevant prompt section:
The prompt instructs that the function should create a `slug` from the words up to the current index to check against `STATE_NAMES`.

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case:
Again, the flawed solution fails to call the `slug` function, which would properly format the string for comparison. As a result, when the input "Sao Paulo Sao Paulo" is processed, it fails to find a match in `STATE_NAMES` because the string being checked is not formatted correctly. The lookup for "Sao Paulo" does not occur as intended, leading to another `ValueError`.
