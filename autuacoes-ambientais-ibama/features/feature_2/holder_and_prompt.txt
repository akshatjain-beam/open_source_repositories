"""
Create a function `split_state_city` that splits a string containing a state identifier (either a two-letter state acronym or a full state name) 
and a corresponding city name into separate components.

The function checks if the first word is a two-letter acronym. If so, it returns the acronym and the 
rest of the text as the city name. If the first word is not a two-letter acronym, it iterates through 
the words to find a full state name. For each word, it creates a `slug` from the 
words up to the current index and checks for a match in the predefined STATE_NAMES dictionary. Upon 
finding a match, it returns the state name and the remaining words (joined together) as the city name. 
If no match is found, a ValueError is raised indicating that the input cannot be recognized.

Args:
    text (str): The input string containing the state identifier and city name.

Returns:
    tuple: A tuple containing the state identifier (either acronym or full name) and the city name.

Raises:
    ValueError: If the input string does not contain a recognizable state identifier.
