"""
Create a class `DomainParts` which inherits class `NamedTuple` representing parts of a domain and its optional subdomain.

Attributes:
domain (str): The main domain name.
subdomain (Optional[str]): The subdomain name, if any. Defaults to None.

Methods:
iter_variants()
The variants are generated by iterating over the parts of the domain (split by '.')
and combining them with the subdomain parts (if subdomain is not None, split by '.').

If the subdomain is provided, the subdomain part consists of the 
segments from the start of the domain up to the current index prepended 
to the subdomain parts. If the subdomain is None, it will remain None 
in the yielded variants.

For each yielding variant of `DomainParts`, the domain part consists of 
the segments starting from the current index to the end of the domain. 
The subdomain part consists of the segments from the start of the domain 
up to the current index, appended to the subdomain parts.


Yields:
DomainParts: A new DomainParts instance with a variant 
of the domain and subdomain.
