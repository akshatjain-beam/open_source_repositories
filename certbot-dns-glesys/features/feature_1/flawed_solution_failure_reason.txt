test_edge_case_empty_subdomain

test_edge_case_no_parts
Relevant Prompt Portion: "The subdomain name, if any. Defaults to None."
Reason: Returns an empty string for the subdomain instead of None when the domain consists of a single part.

test_no_subdomain

Reason: Incorrectly yields an empty string for the subdomain instead of None when no subdomain is provided.

test_subdomain_with_multiple_parts
Relevant Prompt Portion: "combining them with the subdomain parts"
Reason: The logic for combining multiple subdomain parts with domain parts is flawed, leading to incorrect output.

Reason: Incorrectly constructs the relationship between the domain and subdomain, failing to yield the expected combinations.
