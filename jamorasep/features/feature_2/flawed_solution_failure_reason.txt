The logic generated by the LLM model is incorrect for the following reasons:
1. It fails to properly convert the input string into the expected list of strings needed for looping in the `check_if_successive_2chars_compose_mora` function. This results in incorrect output and subsequent test case failures. Specifically, it does not convert the entire input string to a list before feeding it to the `check_if_successive_2chars_compose_mora` function, leading to incorrect input and, consequently, incorrect output.
2. The LLM-generated solution treats `[BOS]` and `[EOS]` as part of the string, which disrupts the intended pairing logic. These tokens should be treated as single string characters instead of separate string characters.
