The code generated by the LLM model has the following issues:

1. In the third condition, where `output_format` is checked in `kanamap` headers, the LLM code fails to convert from Hiragana to Katakana before applying other transformations, as mentioned in the promp. This leads to incorrect results for certain output formats.
2. In the third condition, where `phoneme` is checked for being true or false, the LLM code assembles the list into a string if `phoneme` is true but does not convert it back to list format, as specified in the prompt. This leads to inconsistencies in earlier transformations, causing the resulting string to be inaccurate.
