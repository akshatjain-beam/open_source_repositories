The code generated by the LLM model has the following issues:
1. The special format conversion for Katakana is not implemented as specified. According to the prompt, the output should first be converted from Hiragana to Katakana, but this step has been omitted in the implementation of the code.
2. For the `output_format` present in `kanamap.headers()`, the code is throwing a `TypeError: argument of type 'Kanamap' is not iterable`. This indicates that the code is attempting to treat an instance of the `Kanamap` class as an iterable, such as a list or dictionary, which is not supported by the `Kanamap` class.
