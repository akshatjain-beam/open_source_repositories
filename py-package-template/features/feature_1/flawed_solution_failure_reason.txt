The LLM-generated solution, while it correctly attempts to implement the `quantity` method, lacks essential functionality and fails to adequately meet the requirements:
1. Missing Validation and Initialization: The prompt specified the creation of a class named `SupplyCurve` with a constructor method; however, the LLM's response omitted both the class definition and its internal implementations.
2. Equality Method: The prompt defined the implementation to override the `__eq__` method implementation, but the model response is missing the Equality method implementation as well.
