    Create a function `__repr__` that returns a string representation of the FolioRecord instance.

    The representation is formatted with the class name followed by
    each field and its corresponding value in the instance. Fields are sorted alphabetically in the output  
    and their values are formatted as follows:
    - If the value is a list, it is represented as is.
    - If the value is not a list, it is enclosed in double quotes.
    If the attribute does not exist, handle missing attributes by None

    Returns:
        str: A string representation of the FolioRecord instance.
              If an instance has the following values:
        
    Example:    
        - id: '123'
        - accession_number: 'A001'
        - title: 'The Great Book'
        - author: 'John Doe'
        - publisher: 'Big Publisher'
        - edition: 'First'
        - year: '2020'
        - isbn_issn: '123-456-789'

        The output of this method would be:
        'FolioRecord(accession_number="A001", author="John Doe", edition="First",
        id="123", isbn_issn="123-456-789", publisher="Big Publisher",
        title="The Great Book", year="2020")'
