The LLM Solution fails as-
1. The fill parameter in the function definition has a default value of 'quals', which is incorrect. The fill parameter should be a boolean indicating whether to add a 'fill' column or not, as per the prompt.
2. Default value of fill should be False, as mentioned in prompt. But such is not ensured in the LLM Generated solution.
3. When fill=True, the named tuple creation step (nt = namedtuple('top5', values + ([fill] if fill else []))) tries to use True as a field name, which is not allowed. The field names of a named tuple cannot be Python keywords.
