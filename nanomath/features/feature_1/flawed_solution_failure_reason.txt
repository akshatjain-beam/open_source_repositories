The LLM Generated solution fails as, The expression `np.where(np.cumsum(readlengths) >= 0.5 * np.sum(readlengths))` returns the indices where the cumulative sum exceeds half of the total sum of the read lengths.
By using np.min on this result, it extracts the smallest index where this condition holds true. However, this does not correspond to the actual N50 value, which is in violation of the prompt, as it expliclty mentions to return the first value from readlength array.
