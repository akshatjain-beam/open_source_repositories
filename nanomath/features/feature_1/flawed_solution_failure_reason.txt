Test cases failed- test_basic_case, test_case_with_fractional_N50, test_case_with_one_read, test_case_with_two_reads
relevant prompt section- "This code snippet returns the first element in the readlengths array at which the cumulative sum exceeds half of the total sum of all readlengths."

Reason- The LLM Generated  solution calculates the position using np.searchsorted, which finds the index of the first value greater than or equal to 0.5 * cumsum[-1]. When it adds 1, it shifts the index incorrectly. This addition of 1 leads to incorrect index leading to incorrect answer or index going out of bounds. Thus casuing test  case to fail.
