"""
Create a function `sort_by_stroke` which sorts a list of names based on their stroke counts.

This function takes a list of names, computes the stroke counts for each name, 
and repeatedly sorts the list based on these stroke counts until the sorting 
criteria (`__char_num_i`) no longer change. After sorting, it removes the stroke 
count data and returns only the list of names.

Args:
    name_list_input (list): A list of names (strings) to be sorted.

Returns:
    list: A sorted list of names based on their stroke counts.
