The LLM-generated code has following issues:
1. The LLM-generated code uses an incorrect loop condition for the `while` loop.
2. It checks the sorting criteria before performing the sorting, which does not align with the prompt's requirements.
3. This approach may lead to an infinite loop or premature termination, as the condition is evaluated before any sorting occurs.
4. The prompt specifically states to check the sorting criteria after sorting, which the LLM-generated code fails to adhere to.
