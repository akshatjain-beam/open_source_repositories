The LLM-generated code has the following issues:
1. Incorrect Order of Comparisons: The llm generated solution prioritizes comparing the current stroke counts, which can lead to index errors if the lists are not managed correctly. This diverges from the prompt, which specifies that previous stroke counts should be compared first when they are equal.
2. Omission of First Character Condition: The LLM fails to restrict the check for the current stroke count being greater than the next only for the first character. Instead, it applies this check to all characters, despite the prompt explicitly stating to focus on the first character.
3. Mismanagement of Subsequent Character Comparisons: For subsequent characters, the LLM incorrectly checks the current position first instead of the previous position, as specified in the prompt. 
   - Furthermore, in the subsequent `True` condition, the LLM code checks the condition for previous values, while the prompt specifies to check the current positions instead.
