The solution generated by the LLM fails to meet the requirements specified in the prompt. The prompt explicitly instructs to preserve the space before the colon, yet the LLM-generated solution does not adhere to this instruction. As a result, the solution becomes error-prone and causes test cases to fail, as it introduces unintended formatting changes. This discrepancy between the prompt's expectations and the LLM's output leads to incorrect behavior in the code.
