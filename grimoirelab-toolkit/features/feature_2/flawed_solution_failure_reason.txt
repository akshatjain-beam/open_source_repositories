The code generated by the LLM has the following issues:
1. The LLM introduced an additional condition: it adds data when `param.default` is not empty. This condition was neither mentioned nor requested in the prompt.  
2. The LLM fails to handle scenarios where any required parameters of a callable are not found; it does not raise the expected `AttributeError` correctly in these cases, which was requested in the prompt.
