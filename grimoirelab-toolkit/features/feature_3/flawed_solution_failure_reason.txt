The solution generated by the LLM has the following issues:
1. The regex only addresses scenarios where parentheses are present, such as in the string "Wed, 26 Oct 2005 15:20:32 -0100 (GMT+1)." It does not account for cases without parentheses, like "Thu, 14 Aug 2008 02:07:59 +0200 CEST," which undermines the requirements mentioned in the prompt to remove the information present after timezone section.
