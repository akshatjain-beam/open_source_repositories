# More Conjugations

Here are more conjugations. Unlike the previous conjugations these are not sentence enders and are more for verb form tranformations.

For use during syllable block logic:

- `-ㅇㄴ`: 운{^}
- `-ㅇㄹ`: 울{^}
- `-ㅇㅁ`: 움{^}

And some to be used individually:

- `ㅅㄹ-ㅇㄴ`: {^}스러운
- `ㅅㄹ-ㅂ`: {^}스럽{^}
