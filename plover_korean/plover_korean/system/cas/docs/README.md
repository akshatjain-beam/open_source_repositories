# Korean Modern C Documentation

The Computer Aided Steno-machine, or CAS, features one of the two modern stenography systems for Korean in use today and was originally created by [Korea Steno](http://www.koreasteno.com/). Korean Modern C is a Korean stenography system based on the system used by Korean CAS machines and is implemented in the [Korean plugin](https://github.com/nsmarkop/plover_korean) for [Plover](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover).

The following documentation is meant to serve as a reference for the theory behind the system for those wishing to learn it. Most sections are just in the format of brief notes I took when studying theory books.

General notes about the system:
