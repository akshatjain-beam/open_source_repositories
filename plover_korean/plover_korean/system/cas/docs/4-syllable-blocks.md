# Syllable Blocks

Syllable blocks form the foundation of the Korean written language and as such the foundation of this system. Ignoring the numbers, the layout as pictured is divided into three main sections:

- Initial consonants; stroked using the left hand.
- Medial vowels; stroked using the thumbs.
- Final consonants; stroked using the right hand.

Being familiar with [Korean syllable block construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul#Morpho-syllabic_blocks) is necessary to understand how such a layout can be used to write every syllable block in the Korean language with ease.

## Initial Consonants

All base consonants are represented directly in the layout and can be used as you would expect. Aspirated and tensed versions require a combination of the base consonants to be written at the same time.

For aspirated versions of consonants, you combine a base consonant with `ㅎ`:

- `ㅎㅈ`: ㅊ
- `ㅎㄱ`: ㅋ
- `ㅎㄷ`: ㅌ
- `ㅎㅂ`: ㅍ

For tensed versions of consonants, you combine a base consonant with `ㅇ`:

- `ㅈㅇ`: ㅉ
- `ㄱㅇ`: ㄲ
- `ㄷㅇ`: ㄸ
- `ㅇㅂ`: ㅃ
- `ㅇㅅ`: ㅆ

In Korean you can never have more than one initial consonant so there is no issue using `ㅎ` and `ㅇ` for this purpose.

If the syllable block being written has an initial consonant of `ㅇ` then it is implied and left out of the stroke. This opens up the initial `ㅇ` to be used for other purposes which will be explored later.

Initial consonants by themselves output briefs rather than the singular letter. For learning syllable block construction their practice must be combined with vowels and optionally final consonants.

## Medial Vowels

Vowels are either used outright or constructed from their base parts for complex vowels. The `*` key is used as a modifier for "doubling" a vowel for complex vowel construction except in the case of `ㅖ`. `ㅖ` is a special case where an easier fingering not requiring pressing three keys with one thumb is chosen over the standard pattern.

All vowels by themselves output their phonetic form. The mapping for each vowel is as follows:

- `ㅗ`: 오
- `ㅏ`: 아
- `ㅜ`: 우
- `-ㅓ`: 어
- `-ㅣ`: 이
- `ㅏㅓ`: 으
- `ㅏㅣ`: 애
- `-ㅓㅣ`: 에
- `ㅗ*`: 요
- `ㅏ*`: 야
- `ㅜ*`: 유
- `-*ㅓ`: 여
- `ㅏ*ㅓ`: 얘
- `ㅗㅓㅣ`: 예
- `ㅏㅓㅣ`: 의
- `ㅗㅣ`: 외
- `ㅜㅣ`: 위
- `ㅗㅏ`: 와
- `ㅜㅓ`: 워
- `ㅗㅏㅣ`: 왜
- `ㅜㅓㅣ`: 웨

## Final Consonants

Final consonants are essentially identical to [initial consonants](#initial-consonants) in terms of how they are written, though they are in different positions and order in the layout.

One key difference is that in Korean you can have the following final consonants that are made up of multiple base consonants:

- ㄳ
- ㄵ
- ㄶ
- ㄺ
- ㄻ
- ㄼ
- ㄽ
- ㄾ
- ㄿ
- ㅀ
- ㅄ

Similar to aspirated and tensed consonants, this just requires you to input both consonants at the same time. These cases do not cause issues with using `ㅎ` and `ㅇ` for aspirated and tensed versions of the consonants as none individually contain either character.

## Examples

Here are some basic examples for how to put all of these rules together:

- `ㅈㅏ`: 자
- `ㅈㅏㅁ`: 잠
- `ㅗㅅ`: 옷
- `-ㅓㄱ`: 억
- `ㅎㄱㅗㅇ`: 콩
- `ㄷㅇㅏㅇ`: 땅
- `ㅎㅗㅣ/ㅏㅓㅣ`: 회의
- `ㅅㅣ/ㄱㅗㅓㅣ`: 시계

Note that all examples above have an implicit attach operator, `{^}`, at the end of them as do all syllable blocks generated using this method.

## Practice

There was a lot of information covered here which would normally be spread across several chapters in a theory book. Take your time practicing syllable block construction as it's very important for using this theory effectively.
