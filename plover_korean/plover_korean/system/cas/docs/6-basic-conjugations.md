# Basic Conjugations

## Block Conjugations

Combine these endings with the initial consonants and medials from syllable block logic to form ad-hoc briefs for conjugated words. They cannot be used alone.

- `-ㄷㄴ`: ㄴ다{^}
- `-ㅂㄴ`: ㅂ니다{^}
- `-ㅂㄴㅅㅈ`: ㅆ습니다{^}
- `-ㄷㅅ`: ㅆ다{^}
- `-ㅂㄴㅅ`: ㅂ니까{^}
- `-ㅂㄴㅅㅁ`: ㅆ습니까{^}
- `-ㄷㅂㅅ`: ㅂ시다{^}

## Block Briefs

The following are briefs for syllable blocks that can be used by themselves in place of syllable block logic but are also useful patterns used as parts of more complicated briefs.

- `ㅎㅁ`: 했{^}
- `ㅇㅅ`: 있{^}
- `ㅇㅂ`: 없{^}
- `ㅇㅏ`: 았{^}
- `ㅇㅓ`: 었{^}
- `ㅇ*ㅓ`: 였{^}
- `ㄱㅅ*`: 겠{^}
- `ㄴㅇ-ㅎ`: 않{^}
- `ㅁ-ㅎ`: 많{^}

## Conjugated Briefs

These use the same concepts as the block endings but are defined explicitly as briefs due to them breaking the rules slightly such as by using block briefs and having punctuation. It is generally advisable to use briefs like these when possible.

- `ㅎㅁ-ㅂㄴ`: 했습니다.
- `ㅎㅁ-ㅂㄴㅅ`: 했습니까?
- `ㅇㅅ-ㅂㄴ`: 있습니다.
- `ㅇㅅ-ㅂㄴㅅ`: 있습니까?
- `ㅇㅂ-ㅂㄴ`: 없습니다.
- `ㅇㅂ-ㅂㄴㅅ`: 없습니까?
- `ㅇㅏㅂㄴ`: 았습니다.
- `ㅇㅏㅂㄴㅅ`: 았습니까?
- `ㅇㅓㅂㄴ`: 었습니다.
- `ㅇㅓㅂㄴㅅ`: 었습니까?
- `ㅇ*ㅓㅂㄴ`: 였습니다.
- `ㅇ*ㅓㅂㄴㅅ`: 였습니까?
- `ㄱㅅ*ㅂㄴ`: 겠습니다.
- `ㄱㅅ*ㅂㄴㅅ`: 겠습니까?
- `ㄴㅇ-ㅂㄴ`: 않습니다.
