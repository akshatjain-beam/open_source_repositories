# ㅇ Key Briefs

The ㅇ key on the left side the layout is not used during syllable block construction for the purpose of opening it up for briefs. Some of these have come up already:

- `ㅇㅣ`: {^}이
- `ㅇㅓㅣ`: {^}에

Some new ones in the same vein are:

- `ㅇㅣㄱ`: {^}이고
- `ㅇㅣㄴ`: {^}이는
- `ㅇㅣㄷ`: {^}이다{^}
- `ㅇㅣㅁ`: {^}이며
- `ㅇㅣㅈ`: {^}이지
- `ㅇㅣㄹ`: {^}이를
- `ㅇㅣㅇ`: {^}이야
- `ㅇㅓㅣㄱ`: {^}에게
- `ㅇㅓㅣㄴ`: {^}에는
- `ㅇㅓㅣㄷ`: {^}에도
- `ㅇㅓㅣㅅ`: {^}에서

Dropping the left ㅇ from the briefs here is a good way to form a re-usable pattern for new briefs of more complex output. A simple example of this using the `ㄱㅅ` brief for 것 and `ㅇㅣㄷ` for 이다:

- `ㄱㅅㅣㄷ`: 것이다{^}

TODO: Go through and find / generate all of these to add to the dictionary
