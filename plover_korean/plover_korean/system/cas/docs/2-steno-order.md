# Steno Order

The keys in this system are individually written as follows, in this order (note: this may differ from the actual CAS system):

1. `1-`
2. `2-`
3. `3-`
4. `4-`
5. `5-`
6. `ㅎ-`
7. `ㅁ-`
8. `ㄱ-`
9. `ㅈ-`
10. `ㄴ-`
11. `ㄷ-`
12. `ㅇ-`
13. `ㅅ-`
14. `ㅂ-`
15. `ㄹ-`
16. `ㅗ-`
17. `ㅏ-`
18. `ㅜ-`
19. `-*`
20. `-ㅓ`
21. `-ㅣ`
22. `-6`
23. `-7`
24. `-8`
25. `-9`
26. `-0`
27. `-ㅎ`
28. `-ㅇ`
29. `-ㄹ`
30. `-ㄱ`
31. `-ㄷ`
32. `-ㅂ`
33. `-ㄴ`
34. `-ㅅ`
35. `-ㅈ`
36. `-ㅁ`

The order of the keys, also known as the steno order, is important as it gives a clear, consistent way to represent the key inside of your dictionary entries or when communicating to others. Everything must be written this way and in this order when the multiple keys are present to work as expected. Unlike the standard system for English stenography, the order of the keys inside of each hand cluster does not neccesarily reflect the order of those keys in the output but the key order when written remains important for the system to understand what your input is.

Notice how keys on the left side of the layout *end* with a hypen and keys on the right side of the layout *start* with a hyphen. When writing multiple keys together, keys on the same side merge their hyphens together to be put at the end of the group for left side and the start of the group for the right side. For example, instead of `ㅎ-ㅈ-` you would write `ㅎㅈ-`. However, if only keys on the left side are used then typically the hyphen is omitted like `ㅎㅈ` whereas if only keys on the right side as used then the hypen is kept. Combining multiple keys together is called a chord or a stroke.

Additionally, the hyphens between the keys merge together if one of the six middle keys is between them. For example instead of writing `ㅎ--ㅓ-ㄱ` you would write `ㅎㅓㄱ`. Instead of `ㅎ--ㄱ` you would write `ㅎ-ㄱ` since it is missing one of the middle keys.

Using these rules, the steno order itself can also be written out as: `12345ㅎㅁㄱㅈㄴㄷㅇㅅㅂㄹㅗㅏㅜ*ㅓㅣ67890ㅎㅇㄹㄱㄷㅂㄴㅅㅈㅁ`.

When you want to write multiple chords together, you must put a `/` between them. For example, `ㅎㅓ` and `ㅎㅏ` would be combined like `ㅎㅓ/ㅎㅏ`. Combining multiple chords together like this can also be referred to as a stroke.
