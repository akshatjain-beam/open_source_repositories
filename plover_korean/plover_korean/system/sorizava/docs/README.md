# Korean Modern S Documentation

Korean Modern S is a Korean stenography system based on the system used by Sorizava machines. This system is not currently possible to use without modifications to setup.cfg to enable the system plugin and manually installing it for running Plover from source. It has not been tested and there is no plan to focus on dictionary work or resolving issues in the system for now, but it's here for future reference / development.

If you have any theory books or other resources for Sorizava that could be of use here, please reach out!
