"""
Create a function `get_stroke_groups` which parses a steno stroke into its logical components.

This function extracts the components of a steno stroke using `STROKE_REGEX` regex, categorizing them into
initial, medial, final, and numeric groups based on a predefined regex pattern.

Args:
    stroke: A string representing the steno stroke to be parsed.

Returns:
    A tuple containing the following components in steno order:
    - initial: The keys in the 'initial' group of the stroke.
    - medial: The keys in the 'medial' group of the stroke.
    - final: The keys in the 'final' group of the stroke (empty string if not present).
    - numbers: The keys in the 'number' group of the stroke (combined from both `number_start` and `number_end`).

Raises:
    KeyError: If the provided stroke is invalid or does not match the expected pattern.

Note:
    - Pull out the dash from the `medial` if it exists

Example:
    >>> get_stroke_groups('STKPWOR')
    ('STKPW', 'OR', '', '')
