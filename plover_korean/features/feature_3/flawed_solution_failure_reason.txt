The solution generated by the LLM failed for the following reasons:
1. The prompt requested a check to determine whether the stroke was valid or not. However, the model omitted this check and did not raise a `KeyError` as required.
2. The prompt specified that the dash should be removed only if it was present in the `medial`. The model incorrectly assumed it should also add a dash to the `final`, which was neither requested nor mentioned in the prompt.
