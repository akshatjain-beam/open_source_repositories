Test case which the flawed solution fails
`test_valid_strokes`

The relevant prompt section
"Note: Pull out the dash from the `medial` if it exists."

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case
The flawed solution allows a dash (`STENO_DASH`) to remain in the medial component, resulting in incorrect output. For example, given the stroke `'ㄱ-ㅏ'`, the expected output should not include the dash, but the flawed code retains it, producing:

```python
('ㄱ', 'ㅏ', '-', '')
```

instead of the correct output:

```python
('ㄱ', 'ㅏ', '', '')
```

Test case which the flawed solution fails
`test_invalid_strokes`

The relevant prompt section
"Raises: KeyError: If the provided stroke is invalid or does not match the expected pattern."

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case
The flawed solution does not raise a `KeyError` for invalid strokes correctly. It lacks adequate checks for cases where the stroke does not match the expected pattern, leading to potential scenarios where an invalid stroke does not trigger an error, causing the test to fail.

Test case which the flawed solution fails
`test_complex_medials`

The relevant prompt section
"Note: Pull out the dash from the `medial` if it exists."

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case
This test case fails because the flawed solution does not properly remove the dash from the medial group. For input like `'ㄱ-ㅗㅏ'`, the expected output should be:

```python
('ㄱ', 'ㅗㅏ', '', '')
```

However, the flawed solution incorrectly retains the dash, leading to an incorrect output.

Test case which the flawed solution fails
`test_separated_numbers`, `test_edge_numbers_right`, `test_edge_numbers_left`, `test_edge_numbers_both`, `test_long_number`, `test_max_number`

The relevant prompt section
"Returns: A tuple containing the following components in steno order: [...] numbers: The keys in the 'number' group of the stroke (combined from both `number_start` and `number_end`)."

Reason why the flawed solution fails the test case
The flawed solution fails to accurately combine the `number_start` and `number_end` groups when a dash is present. Specifically, if the dash appears in the `medial`, the model removes it from the medial component but incorrectly adds it to the `final` component, which is not specified in the prompt. This addition of the dash to the final component causes the assertions in the `lookup` function (located in `plover_korean/plover_korean/system/cas/dictionaries/ko_cas_numbers.py`) to fail, as the code expects the final component to be empty.
