"""
Create a function `lookup` that Retrieves the text output corresponding to the provided strokes.

Args:
    strokes: A tuple of strokes to look up text for.

Returns:
    The text text output for the stroke.

Raises:
    KeyError: The lookup failed to find any matching text.

Notes:
    If the input strokes are invalid or cannot be parsed, a KeyError is raised.
    The function uses the INITIAL, MEDIAL, and FINAL dictionaries to compose the text output.
    The hgtk library is used to compose the text output into a single Unicode character.
    If any errors occur during the lookup or composition process, a KeyError is raised.
    If length of strokes is not equal to LONGEST_KEY , a KeyError is raised.
