Test case failed-Test Case: test_length_one ,TestLookupSyllableBlocks::test_initial_h_medial_o, TestLookupSyllableBlocks::test_initial_m_medial_a etc
Relevant prompt section- 1. "The function uses the INITIAL, MEDIAL, and FINAL dictionaries to map the stroke components to text."
                         2. "The hgtk.text library's DEFAULT_COMPOSE_CODE is used to compose the final text output."
Reason - 1.The LLM Generated solution attempts to call hgtk.text.compose with three arguments (initial, medial, final), leading to a TypeError because compose only accepts one or two positional arguments.[ The LLM Generated solution doesn't use DEFAULT_COMPOSE_CODE, despite explicit mention in prompt.] When the TypeError occurs inside the try block, it is caught by the except block, which then raises a KeyError.
2.The LLM Generated solution doesn't maps initial, medial, final to INITIAL, MEDIAL, and FINAL dictionaries leading to incorrect output.
