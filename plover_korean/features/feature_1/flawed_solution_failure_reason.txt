The LLM Generated solution fails to correctly implement the mappings in both the INITIAL and MEDIAL dictionaries.
ex- 'ㄱㅇ': 'ㄱ': The mapping should be 'ㄱㅇ': 'ㄲ'. This indicates that when 'ㄱ' is followed by 'ㅇ', it combines to form a double consonant 'ㄲ'.
The LLM Generated solution does not implement the mappings correctly thus results in erronous output.
