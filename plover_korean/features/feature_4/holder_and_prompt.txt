"""
Write a Regular expression pattern to match Korean consonant-vowel pairs.

This pattern is designed to match the structure of Korean characters, 
which consist of an initial consonant, a medial vowel, and a final consonant.
The pattern is divided into five groups (each group can contain multiple characters):

* `number_start`: Matches any of the digits 1-5 (optional)
* `initial`: Matches any of the Korean consonants ㅎ, ㅁ, ㄱ, ㅈ, ㄴ, ㄷ, ㅇ, ㅅ, ㅂ, ㄹ (optional)
* `medial`: Matches any of the Korean vowels ㅗ, ㅏ, ㅜ, \-, *, ㅓ, ㅣ (optional)
* `number_end`: Matches any of the digits 6-9, 0 (optional)
* `final`: Matches any of the Korean consonants ㅎ, ㅇ, ㄹ, ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㄴ, ㅅ, ㅈ, ㅁ (optional)
Note:
    The pattern must match the entire string, as indicated by the `^` and `$` anchors.

Example:
     "ㅈㅏ*" -> { 'number_start': '', 'initial': 'ㅈ', 'medial': 'ㅏ*', 'number_end': '', 'final': '' }
