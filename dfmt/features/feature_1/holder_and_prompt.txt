"""
Implement a funcion `split_regions` that splits the input text 
into regions based on line prefixes.

As the function processes each line, it tracks the current prefix. 
When lines share the same prefix, they are combined into a single 
region; otherwise, a new region is created. When adding the new line
in the region, add the new line character to the line 

Args:
    text (str): The input text

Returns:
    list: A list of Region objects
