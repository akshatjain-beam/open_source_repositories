Test case Failed -TestAttributeDetection::test_bool_type
Reason - The prompt does not specify any attribute type labeled as unknown. However, the generated solution from the LLM independently creates this unknown category and incorrectly classifies the boolean type under it. This misclassification is the reason for the failure of the test cases.
