"""
Create a function `calculate_attr_types` that's calculates the attribute types of the columns of the given data frame.
Based on the data type of the column, the attribute type is determined. If
the column is a number, it is further analyzed to determine if it is a
year, timestamp, integer or float, using `_detect_number_column` function. If the column is a string, it is further
analyzed to determine if it is a list of strings or a single string.

If column is of a number type, it  it uses `_detect_number_column` function to checks the values of the column in the
data frame. If the values are all integers, it is an `integer`. If the
values are all floats, it is a `float`. If the values are all years, i.e.
all values fall in range between 1800 and 2100, it is a `year`. If the
values are all timestamps, i.e. all values fall in range between 1000000000
and 9999999999, it is a `timestamp`. 
If the column is a string, it checks the values of the column in the data
frame. If the values are all strings, it is a `string`. If the values are
all lists of strings, i.e. any value contains a character '|', it is a
`liststring`.

Parameters
----------
df: DataFrame. The data frame to be analyzed.

Returns
-------
`Dict[str, ATTR_TYPE]`: A dictionary with the column names as keys and the
attribute types as values.
