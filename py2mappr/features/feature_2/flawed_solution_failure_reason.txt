Unit tests failed- TestFindNodeColorAttr::test_multiple_columns and TestFindNodeColorAttr::test_all_missing_column
Reason-
The LLM-generated solution fails in both test cases due to flawed functional and logical implementation. The prompt explicitly states that the preferred columns are those with the least unique values. After identifying these preferred columns, the next step is to select the ones that have the least null values among them.
While the LLM-generated solution correctly sorts all the columns based on their unique values, it then incorrectly passes all columns to the _find_most_filled_column function instead of just those that have the least unique values. This approach results in an incorrect list of columns being evaluated in _find_most_filled_column, ultimately leading to incorrect results.
