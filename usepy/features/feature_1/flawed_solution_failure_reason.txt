1. The code generated by the LLM fails to properly update `original_str_temp` within the "while" loop, leading to an infinite loop that prevents further execution. 
2. The cause of this infinite loop is that, when updating `original_str_temp`, the model does not account for the length of `end_str`, which is necessary for accurate substring processing.
