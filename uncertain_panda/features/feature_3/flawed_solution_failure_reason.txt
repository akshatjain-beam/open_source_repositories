The LLM generated solution fails as-
1.the code attempts to call series.median(). However, numpy.ndarray does not have a method called median(). This results in an AttributeError. It is making wrong functional call as it is not refrncing the module form which median is implemented, which is numpy.
2. IndexError occurs because the code calculates an index based on the length of the series. Specifically, when cl is set to 1.0, the expression int(cl * len(series)) equals the length of series. This results in an out-of-bounds index since indexing starts at 0 and goes to length-1.
