"""
Plots data from a DataFrame with associated uncertainty.

This function plots the values of a specified key in the DataFrame along with error bars
representing the uncertainty. The uncertainty is calculated from the standard deviation 
values provided in the DataFrame.

Parameters:
df : pandas.DataFrame
    The DataFrame containing the data to be plotted. It must include columns for the 
    specified key and its associated standard deviations.
    
key : str
    The key (column name) in the DataFrame for which to plot the values and uncertainty.

**kwargs : keyword arguments
    Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the plotting functions, such as 
    formatting options for the plot.

Returns:
matplotlib.container.ErrorbarContainer
    A container for the error bars created by the errorbar plot, which can be used 
    for further customization or access to plotted data.

Notes:
If the DataFrame includes a 'nominal_value' attribute, it will plot the nominal values 
with standard deviation error bars. If neither conditions are met, it will default to a 
simple plot without error bars.
