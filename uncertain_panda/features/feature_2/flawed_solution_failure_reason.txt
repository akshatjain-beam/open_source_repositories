The LLM Generated solution fails as,The errors in unit test occur because the function implementation uses df.std_dev_left and df.std_dev_right, but the test DataFrames do not have these columns. The prompt specifies that if key is not provided, the function should check for the nominal_value attribute and plot it with its standard deviation (std_dev). However, the implementation incorrectly references df.std_dev_left and df.std_dev_right instead of df.std_dev
