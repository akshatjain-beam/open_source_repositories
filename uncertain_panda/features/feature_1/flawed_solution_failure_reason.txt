The LLM-generated code has the following issues:
1. The calculation for finding the values for the right side when b is not None is incorrect. Even though the prompt explicitly mentioned to take the given input values of a and b as they are, the prompt modified the values for the right-hand side, resulting in incorrect results and not adhering to the prompt's instructions.
