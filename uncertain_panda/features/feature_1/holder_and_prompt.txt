"""
Return the confidence interval based on bootstrapped results.

This method calculates the confidence interval [left, right] such that
a fraction ``a`` of the bootstrapped results falls below ``left`` and
a fraction ``b`` of the results falls above ``right``. 

If `b` is None, the symmetric interval is calculated as follows:
    - left = (1 - a) / 2
    - right = (1 + a) / 2
Else, provide
    - `a` to left
    - `b` to right

Parameters:
a : float, optional
    The fraction of results to be excluded from the lower tail. 
    Default is ONE_SIGMA / 100.
b : float, optional
    The fraction of results to be excluded from the upper tail. 
    If None, it defaults to the same value as ``a`` for a symmetric interval.

Returns:
pd.Series
    A pandas Series containing three elements:
    - 'value': the nominal value of the statistic.
    - 'left': the lower bound of the confidence interval.
    - 'right': the upper bound of the confidence interval.

Notes:
- The method utilizes bootstrapping to generate the quantiles.
- Ensure that the bootstrapped results are available via the `bs` method before calling `ci`.
