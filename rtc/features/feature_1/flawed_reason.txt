The LLM Generation solution attempts to assign valide.JSONRawMessage as the validator when the Column's Type is "json.RawMessage". However, this approach is flawed because valide.JSONRawMessage does not exist in the valide package. By incorrectly assuming the presence of this non-existent validator, the implementation leads to a build failure, halting the function's compilation and causing unit tests to fail. The root cause of this issue is the reliance on an undefined validator that disrupts the validation flow.
