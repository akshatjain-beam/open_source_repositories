The prompt explicitly specifies that the case of the file extension must be preserved â€” meaning that uppercase extensions should remain uppercase, and lowercase extensions should remain lowercase. However, the LLM-generated solution incorrectly uses to_Lower, which converts all extensions to lowercase, deviating from the requirements outlined in the prompt.

For the test case "handle .JSONNET extension," the expectation is that uppercase extensions will trigger an error. However, due to the erroneous conversion in the LLM-generated solution, the extension is converted to lowercase, causing the test case to pass without triggering the expected error. This leads to a failure in the test case, as it doesn't behave as intended.
