 The prompt does not specifically mention that uppercase extensions should be normalized to lowercase. The LLM Generated solution does it on its own. The test case ("handle .JSONNET extension"), it is clear to expect that the uppercase extensions will trigger an error. However erronous conversion by LLM Generated solution causes Test case to pass, leading to not triggering error, ultimately resulting in failed test case.
