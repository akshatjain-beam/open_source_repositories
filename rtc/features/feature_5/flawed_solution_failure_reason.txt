The LLM Grenertaed solution fails as- 
1. It fails to insert ErrorsSeparator at the end of each output.
2. It incorrectly inserts the separator before the first non-nil error in the list, even when there are nil values at the beginning of the slice. This results in a leading separator ("; foo"), which is incorrect.
This results in test cases to fails.
