The error in the LLM Generated solution arises from the use of `\s` (space) in the regular expression `fullVErrRegex = regexp.MustCompile("validation error:\s(.*?)\s\. At")`. This regex expects spaces around the message and before `. At`, but the input error string often doesn't contain such spaces. This space is nowhere provided in the prompt and the LLM model assumes on it own. As a result, the regex fails to match error messages like `"validation error: bar"` or `"validation error: baz"`, which don't have spaces around them. This causes the `UnwrapValidationError` function to return `nil` instead of the expected error message, leading to test failures where the output is `<nil>` instead of the correct validation message (e.g., `"bar"` or `"baz"`).
