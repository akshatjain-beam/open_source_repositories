// Create a `fullVErrRegex` which is the regular expression, which matches strings with validation error: , followed by any number of characters (which are captured in groups), and ending with At.
//Create a `tinyVErrRegex` which is the regular expression, which matches strings with validation error: , followed by any number of characters (which are captured in groups)
//
// Than Create `UnwrapValidationError` function that takes an error, checks if it's a validation error, 
// and extracts a clean message from it. If the error is nil or 
// contains no message, it returns nil. If the error string contains 
// the substring ". At", it uses a regex pattern tailored for full validation errors; 
// otherwise, it applies a regex pattern for smaller errors. The function trims 
// any leading "validation error: " and trailing ". At" from the extracted message 
// before returning it as a new error.
  
// Parameters:
//   vErr (error): The error to be unwrapped. If it's nil or its message is empty, 
//   nil is returned.

// Returns:
//   error: A new error with the extracted validation message, or nil if the input 
//   error is empty or nil.
