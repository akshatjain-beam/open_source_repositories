The LLM-generated solution fails due to redundant delimiter insertions. Specifically, the code inserts the delimiter both before and after certain letters during case transitions, which results in extra delimiters (e.g., many__many instead of many_many). This issue arises because the first two if blocks for isUpper are causing the delimiter to be inserted twice â€” once before and once after the uppercase letter. As a result, two delimiters are added instead of just one, leading to erroneous output.
