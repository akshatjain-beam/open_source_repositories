The LLM Generated solution fails as the shouldCapitalize flag is initially false, which prevents the first letter of the first word from being capitalized in the LLM Generated solution. This issue results in erroneous outputs like "testCase" instead of "TestCase". The flag should be initialized as true to correctly capitalize the first letter of the first word in the string.
