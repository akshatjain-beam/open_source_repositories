"""
Encode a given binary string to a base2p15 encoded string.

This encoding method converts the input binary string into chunks of 15 bits,
pads the string if necessary, and maps each chunk to a corresponding character
in a custom base2p15 encoding. The encoded string starts with a hex character
representing the number of padding bits added.

Parameters
----------
bit_string : str
    A binary string (e.g., "00001001").

Returns
-------
str
    The base2p15 encoded string.

Notes
-----
- The function pads the input binary string to ensure its length is a multiple
    of 15 by appending '0' bits.
- The first character of the output string represents the number of padding bits
    added (in hexadecimal).
- No padding is required if length of input string is already a multiple of 15
- Each 15-bit chunk of the padded binary string is then converted to an integer,
    which is mapped to a character by adding an offset of 0xA1 (161 in decimal).
- The function uses the `gen_chunks` helper function to split the input string
    into 15-bit chunks.
