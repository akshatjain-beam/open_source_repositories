# 1. Iterate over the `documents` and do the following:
# 2. Initialize an empty `bitarray` instance.
# 3. Open the binary file and convert its content into a binary string.
# 4. Encode the binary string using the `base2p15_encode` function.
# 5. Create a list containing the encoded data and document metadata from index 1 to the end of the list, then add the data at index 0.
# 6. Append this list to the `base2p15_arrs` list.
