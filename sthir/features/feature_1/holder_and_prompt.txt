"""
Make a function process_documents which do the following:

Processes a list of documents by encoding their binary content and preserving metadata.

1. Iterate over each document in the dataset.
2. For each document, initialize a storage mechanism for the binary data.
3. Read the binary file from the document index 0, which contains the file path and extract its binary content.
4. Convert the binary content into a binary string format.
5. Encode this binary string using the `base2p15_encode` function to compress the data.
6. Collect the encoded data along with relevant document metadata, excluding the first item in the list.
7. Merge the initial item with the rest of the collected metadata and encoded data.
8. Append the resulting data structure to the base2p15_arrs collection for further processing or storage.

Args:
documents (list): A list of documents where each document is represented as a list
of elements
Returns:
base2p15_arrs (list): A list of lists
