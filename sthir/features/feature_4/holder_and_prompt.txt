"""
Decode a base2p15 encoded string into a binary string.
The first character of the encoded string represents the 
number of padding bits to ignore in the last 15-bit sequence.

Note:
Last character may be  partially used based on the padding value. 
Convert the last character of the input string to its ASCII value, 
subtract the offset, and convert to a binary string.

:param base2p15: A base2p15 encoded string 
:type base2p15: str

:returns: A binary string representing the decoded binary data
:rtype: str
