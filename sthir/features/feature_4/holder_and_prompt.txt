Decode a base2p15 encoded string into a binary string.

The base2p15 encoding represents binary data using a specific encoding scheme:
- The first character of the `base2p15` string specifies the number of padding bits 
    (0-15) that need to be removed from the last 15-bit segment.
- Each character (except the first and last) in the remaining portion of the `base2p15` 
    string encodes a full 15-bit segment of the binary data.
- The last character encodes the final segment of the binary data, which may be less 
    than 15 bits if padding is applied.

:param base2p15: A base2p15 encoded string where:
                    - The first character indicates the number of padding bits to be removed
                    from the final 15-bit segment.
                    - Each character (except the last) represents a 15-bit segment of the binary data.
                    - The last character represents the final segment and is padded to 15 bits
                    but only includes the significant bits after removing padding.
:type base2p15: str
:returns: A binary string representing the decoded binary data, concatenated from all 15-bit 
            segments, with the final segment truncated according to the padding specification.
:rtype: str

The decoding process involves:
1. Extracting Padding Information: The number of padding bits is determined from the first character
    of the base2p15 string.
2. Decoding 15-bit Segments: For each character in the string (excluding the first and last), 
    it is converted from its ASCII value to a 15-bit binary string.
3. Handling the Final Segment: The last character is processed similarly but is truncated according 
    to the padding information to obtain the correct length for the final segment.
4. Concatenation: All decoded 15-bit segments are concatenated together to form the final binary string.
