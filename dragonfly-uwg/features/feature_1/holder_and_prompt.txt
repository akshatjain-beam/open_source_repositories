This Attempts to infer the UWG building program from the honeybee-energy program.
The inferring will happen by first finding the most common energy ProgramType
among the assigned Room2Ds. If the identifier of this most common program
contains the name of an acceptable UWG building program, it will be assigned
as this object's building program. If no match is found or there's no
honeybee-energy extension installed, this object's program will remain unchanged.
