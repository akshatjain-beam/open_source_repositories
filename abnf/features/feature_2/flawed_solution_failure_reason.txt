Unit test failed-test_extended_language_range
Relevant prompt section - One or more (`1*`) sequences of 8-bit alphabetic characters (ALPHA) or a single asterisk ("*").
- Optionally followed by zero or more repetitions (`*`) of a hyphen ("-") followed by one or more (`1*`) alphanumeric characters (alphanum) or another asterisk ("*").
Reason-  The LLM Genearted solution fails the test case because it does not correctly accommodate the input *-en:
Mandatory Structure: The LLM Geneated solution incorrectly enforces that an ALPHA sequence must precede any hyphen or alphanumeric subtag. Thus, when it encounters the wildcard (*), it expects additional characters which leads to a parsing error.
Wildcards Not Handled: The input starts with a wildcard (*), which the LLM Generated solution does not allow as a valid starting point, leading to a `Parse Error` when the input is evaluated against the defined grammar.
