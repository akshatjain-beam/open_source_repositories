"""
Color a graph of triangles using a gradient.

1. First, the function figures out the diagonal length of the image. This helps it understand the overall size of the image.
2. Next, for each triangle, it finds the center point (centroid) by averaging the positions of the triangle’s corners.
3. Then, it checks that this center point is within the image’s edges to make sure it doesn’t go out of bounds.
4. After that, it calculates how far this center point is from the image’s starting corner, and expresses this distance as a fraction of the image’s diagonal length.
5. Finally, the function uses this fraction to pick a color from the gradient, giving each triangle its corresponding color based on where its center is located in the image.

Arguments:
gradient is a Gradient object
image_size is a tuple of the output dimensions, i.e. (width, height)
triangles is a list of vertex-defined Triangle objects

Returns:
A list of Color objects, one per triangle such that colors[i] is the color
of triangle[i]
