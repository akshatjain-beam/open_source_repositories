1. The logic in the code generated by the LLM is flawed. 
2. It tries to convert a tuple into an edge-based triangle through a function call, but it should instead be provided with a triangle object. 
3. In the original function, since the input can be either a tuple or a triangle, it should have checked whether the input is a triangle before attempting the conversion. 
4. This mismatch is leading to errors.
